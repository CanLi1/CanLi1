# Research

Our overarching goal is to develop theory, algorithms, models, and software for large-scale optimization problems with applications in sustainable energy systems, for which we rely on mathematical programming and machine learning techniques.

Here are several research areas that we currently work on:

**Sustainable energy systems design** 
The major economies in the world including the U.S., EU, and China all have set their goals to achieve net
zero carbon emission in the next few decades. As process systems engineers, we aim to design
sustainable energy systems to help transition to the carbon-neutral future. The new designs incorporate the chemical industry, the electricity systems that
have both thermal and renewable generation sources, the natural gas system, etc. The tightly coupled
energy systems could yield significant economic and environmental benefits. In addressing this problem,
large-scale optimization problems have to be solved because of the spatial and temporal complexity of the integrated
design and operation problems. In addition, huge amount of data from various industries  have to be processed in
 meaningful ways. To develop capabilities for solving these problems, we aim to
advance the field of mathematical optimization and machine learning.
