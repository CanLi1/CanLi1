   abstract = {When faced with a limited budget of function evaluations, state-of-the-art black-box optimization (BBO) solvers struggle to obtain globally, or sometimes even locally, optimal solutions. In such cases, one may pursue solution polishing, i.e., a computational method to improve (or “polish”) an incumbent solution, typically via some sort of evolutionary algorithm involving two or more solutions. While solution polishing in “white-box” optimization has existed for years, relatively little has been published regarding its application in costly-to-evaluate BBO. To fill this void, we explore two novel methods for performing solution polishing along one-dimensional curves rather than along straight lines. We introduce a convex quadratic program that can generate promising curves through multiple elite solutions, i.e., via path relinking, or around a single elite solution. In comparing four solution polishing techniques for continuous BBO, we show that solution polishing along a curve is competitive with solution polishing using a state-of-the-art BBO solver.},
