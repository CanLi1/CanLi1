- title: "Physics-informed neural networks with hard linear equality constraints"
  image: 2024CACE.png
  description:  Physics-informed neural network (PINN) leverages known physical constraints present in the data, but it cannot strictly satisfy them in the predictions. We propose an architecture to rigorously guarantee hard linear equality constraints through projection layers derived from KKT conditions.

  description: One of the primary barriers to deploying optimization or machine learning models in practice is the challenge of helping practitioners understand and interpret such models. We propose a first-of-its-kind system that enables natural language-based diagnosis and troubleshooting for infeasible optimization models using LLM.

However, spatial and temporal variations complicate the adoption of renewable energy. We propose a multi-scale MILP model for locating modular electrified plants, renewable-based generating units, and power lines in a microgrid.

To achieve this goal, the electricity capacity needs to be expanded in the next 30 years under high renewable penetration. We propose a mathematical model and several solution techniques for expanding the capacity in the Texas region.

  description: Renewable generation and load demand can vary significantly from day to day. To capture the variations of renewable and improve the reliability of the power systems, we propose machine learning-based methods for selecting some representative days in the capacity expansion planning model. The inclusion of the extreme events reduce the risk of blackouts in power systems planning.

  description: Natural gas price has high volatility and is challenging to have an accurate forecast. Upstream developers in the natural gas industry always face the uncercertainty in the natural gas price. A low natural gas price can make it unprofitable to develop wells. We solve this problem by developing a stochastic programming framework to help upstream operators make scheduling decisions on their wellpad under high uncertainty of natural gas price.
